- Task Creation: Easily create tasks, specifying details such as task name, description, and status.

- Task Update: Keep your tasks up to date by modifying their details, including status changes to reflect progress.

- Task Deletion: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks to maintain a clean and clutter-free task list.

- Status Filtering: View tasks based on their status, allowing you to focus on pending, in-progress, or completed tasks as needed.

## How to Get Started
- User Registration: Begin by registering as a user to access the full functionality of the Task Manager App.

- Task Creation: After registration, start creating tasks by providing essential details. Feel free to include additional information to make your tasks more descriptive.

- Task Updates: As tasks evolve, update their status and details to keep your task list accurate and reflective of your progress.

- Task Deletion: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant or have been successfully completed to maintain an organized task list.

## Security
We prioritize the security of your data. User authentication ensures that only authorized individuals have access to task management features, providing a safe and reliable environment for your personal and professional task management needs.

## Technologies used:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)

  1. Cognito Pool: To manage user base, assign user role.
  2. Cognito Identity Provider: To issue IAM credential to access the service.
  3. DynamoDB: As database
  4. AWS Lambda: to auto confirm cognito user and host api on a serverless framework which is cost effective.
  5. API Gateway: To expose the endpoint for the apis, also used as an authentication layer and integrated with AWS lambda.
  6. Cloudwatch Logs: For logging and monitoring 
  7. S3: For static website hosting.

- Mocha, Chai & Sinon: For unit testing.
- ReactJs: For frontend design.

## Components

1. `base-infra`: This includes deployment of basic infrastructure, ex: database (DynamoDB) and AWS Cognito Pool and Identity Provider for authentication and authorization and user management.


3. `backend`: This is a `npm` project as well as `serverless` project. `serverless.yml` includes configuration for deployment of lamda serverless apis.

4. `frontend`: A sample UI project which demonstrates the api in use.

## Deployment

To deploy the Task Manager project on AWS, follow the steps below:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create and manage ECS resources.
2. AWS and Serverless CLI installed and configured with the appropriate IAM credentials.

## AWS Deployment

1. Clone the git repository
2. Run `npm install` under all the `npm` sub folders
3. run the bash file `deploy-infra.sh`
4. Build the front end react project and deploy it. use the API gateway Resource endpoint to configure it to the frontend.
5. make sure all the AWS resources are deployed properly


## NOTE

- Get the API gateway base url from the AWS console or through aws cli. You can use it to invoke the server with appropriate aws IAM credentials. Also you can configure this url in the frontend project.
